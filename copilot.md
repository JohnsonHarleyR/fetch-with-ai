<h1>Thoughts About CoPilot</h1>
<p>
This was my initial thought before trying Copilot: To be honest, the idea of using AI to write code kind-of annoys me and takes the joy out of coding. The reason I started learning to code in the first place is because I found it to be a fun, creative challenge. Having a computer figure out how to write code for me, beyond giving me hints, simply takes away the appeal of coding. It does not help one to truly develop problem-solving and coding skills. Also, I would rather write code that I intuitively understand than have to spend time interpreting generated code and having to look for mistakes. I realize this is part of being a software developer, having to read and fix code that you did not write, but the idea of having to review and fix computer written code just annoys me lol.

After using it: First of all, I am impressed by this. It wrote very clean code that mostly worked. I had to tweak it a couple of  times, but for the most part, it worked great. Maybe this is because I gave it very specific commands. Whatever the case, it kind-of humbles and depresses me that AI can write such clean code in so little time at my command and it works almost right away. This makes me a bit worried for my career lol. I suppose, though, that is was good for me to try writing some of this code without help from the Copilot first so that I could learn it myself. It helped me know what the ask it to write. It helped me to understand the code that it generated. It also helped me to identify where it might need fixing... I also noticed that it came up with some of the same solutions that I did, but found new ways to write the code that I had not thought of. I suppose I can use it as a learning tool.

As far as using ChatGPT vs Claude... Well, I wasn't able to use the ChatGPT Copilot extension because it required a key... However, when I downloaded the GitHub Copilot extension, I was able to switch between ChatGPT 4.0 and other sources, so this is what I did. I honestly did not notice much difference between the two. Both seemed to perform equally well for the tasks that I gave them. (P.S. I am suddenly wondering if it was taking some of the code I had already written in order to generate the code I asked it to generate, since a lot of it was similar.)
