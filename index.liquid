    <p>So this code is similar to the one above, but I was trying to do it using Alpine. I couldn't get it to work, so I asked ChatGPT copilot for help. I was surprised to see it explain exactly why it wasn't working, and then give me a revised code. The code still did not work, but I only had to tweak one thing and now it works!</p>
